# Labyrinth in pygame
# What's that?
It's a little video game to help mcgyver to find these objects and his way through a maze.

# When did you work on it?
I carried out this project in one week from 25/05/2020 to 02/06/2020.

# My progress
The project is entirely finished, the version on github is thus the last one.

# What's in it?
This code works very simply, the robot advances using a double list and pygame continuously displays the transformed list.

# How do we set it up? 
To install my project, you have to clone my folder and then launch the main.exe file located in the build/exe.win-amd64-3.7 folder.
